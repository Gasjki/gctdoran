                            Hey! Welcome to my CV!<br/><br/>
                            I did it just to learn <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"
                                                      class="border-b-4 border-yellow-200 font-semibold">TailwindCSS</a>.
                            Also, I needed a new CV to reflect what changed in the last years.
                            I'll try not to bore you, but when were the CVs ever interesting? We will see...<br/><br/>
                            My name is <span class="border-b-4 border-yellow-200 font-semibold">Tudoran George-Cristian</span>
                            (24 years) and I live near the Bucharest.
                            I started programming by modifing <a

                                class="border-b-4 border-yellow-200 font-semibold">nulled scripts</a> while I was trying to
                            create my own browser-based game.<br /><br />
                            After high school, I attended to "Romanian-American University". I spent 5 years in this university and I have to admit
                            that if you are an autodidact (like me!), you will have time for everything! You will still have projects and deadlines,
                            but you won't go crazy! This was the time when I started to improve my programming skills. <span class="border-b-4 border-yellow-200 font-semibold">#free</span>

                            <span class="border-b-4 border-yellow-200 font-semibold">#TrustMeIWasNotPaid</span><br /><br />
                            During my student years, I participated to IoT: Hackathon (2016) which was held by Microsoft and I managed to win
                            the 1st place with my colleagues. After that, we qualified for the Imagine Cup Romania's final were we won 2nd place.<br /><br />
                            Right now I'm working for <a href="https://zitec.com/" class="border-b-4 border-yellow-200 font-semibold">Zitec</a> and I'm trying to balance
                            my worklife with other activities like: tennis, cycling, working on my side projects or filming with my drone. <br /><br />
                            If you haven't gotten bored yet, I invite you to look further to see the more detailed information. Cheers!

                                        Application was started in 2016 and has been in a continuous development ever since.

                                        C3PO is a project started one year ago and it is dedicated to our financing team.
                                        Because the finances are hard and we didn't have a great solution back then, we created
                                        a small robot capable to extract all invoices from Xero and import them in SAGA, without any user input.
                                        We used a PHP application to extract the invoices using APIs, to normalize them, then to
                                        expose a new API for our robot.

                                        This was my first big project after internship. This project was started in 2017 and it's an internal
                                        application for the Sandton Capital - an American investment fund. Even if I started as a Software Developer,
                                        I continued to work until we finished the project at the end of 2019 when I already was a Software Engineer.
                                        I've made multiple optimizations and I applied complex mathematics formulas to have live status of all balances.
                                        It was challenging for me because we had to link multiple Excel and Access Database files which were far from a
                                        standard form of normalization and we did that by building an algorithm capable to import and match
                                        those transactions and loans.

                            I'd love to have more time to create other applications, but that's not possible. I already have multiple ideas
                            noted on my phone and I'm trying to work only on 2-3 applications at the same time. I had dozens of applications
                            started, but never finished, mostly because I hated the design I made at that time and that's why I think
                            multiple times before starting a new idea.
